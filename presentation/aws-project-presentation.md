## Slide 4: AWS Services Used
**Core Services:**
1. **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute functions
2. **Amazon API Gateway** - REST API endpoints
3. **Amazon DynamoDB** - NoSQL database
4. **Amazon S3** - Static website hosting
5. **AWS CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as code
6. **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging
7. **AWS IAM** - Security and permissions

## Slide 7: Data Model
**Task Document Structure:**
```json
{
  "taskId": "uuid",
  "userId": "default-user",
  "title": "Task title",
  "description": "Task description",
  "status": "pending|in-progress|completed",
  "priority": "low|medium|high",
  "category": "general|work|personal",
  "dueDate": "2024-01-01",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Slide 8: Lambda Functions

**1. GetTasks Function:**
- Retrieves tasks with optional filtering
- Supports query by status, priority, category
- Returns paginated results

**2. CreateTask Function:**
- Validates input data
- Generates unique task ID
- Stores in DynamoDB

**3. UpdateTask Function:**
- Updates existing tasks
- Partial updates supported
- Timestamp tracking

**4. DeleteTask Function:**
- Removes tasks from database
- Soft delete implementation

---

## Slide 9: Security & Best Practices

**Security Measures:**
- IAM roles with least privilege
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- Error handling

**Best Practices Implemented:**

- Environment variables for configuration
- Proper error responses
- Logging and monitoring

---

## Slide 10: Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: CORS Configuration**
- Problem: Frontend couldn't access API
- Solution: Configured CORS in API Gateway and Lambda responses

**Challenge 2: DynamoDB Query Optimization**
- Problem: Inefficient data retrieval
- Solution: Implemented Global Secondary Indexes

**Challenge 3: Error Handling**
- Problem: Unclear error messages
- Solution: Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
