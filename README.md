# Smart Document Management System

## Project Overview
A cloud-based document management system that provides intelligent document processing, storage, and analysis using AWS services.

## Features
- Secure document upload and storage
- AI-powered text extraction (OCR)
- Intelligent document summarization
- Advanced search capabilities
- User authentication and management
- Real-time document processing status

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**: Document storage
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless backend processing
- **Amazon API Gateway**: REST API endpoints
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Document metadata and user data
- **Amazon Textract**: OCR and text extraction
- **Amazon Comprehend**: AI text analysis and summarization
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **AWS IAM**: Security and permissions
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Infrastructure deployment

## Architecture
The system follows a serverless architecture pattern with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Static website hosted on S3 with CloudFront
2. **API Layer**: RESTful APIs via API Gateway
3. **Processing Layer**: Lambda functions for document processing
4. **Storage Layer**: S3 for documents, DynamoDB for metadata
5. **AI Services**: Textract and Comprehend for intelligent processing
6. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logging and metrics

## Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy infrastructure using CloudFormation templates
2. Configure IAM roles and permissions
3. Deploy Lambda functions
4. Upload frontend to S3
5. Configure API Gateway endpoints

## Cost Estimation
All services are designed to stay within AWS Free Tier limits for the first 12 months.

## Security Features
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- S3 bucket encryption
- API Gateway authentication
- Secure document upload with presigned URLs
